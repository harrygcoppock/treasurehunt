# treasurehunt

Can you find the treasure??? Clone this repo locally and try and get the treasure back home safely using ONLY shell commands.


The person who gets the chest, WITH the key to unlock it in the 'home' directory first wins. 
You will also need to provide a copy of your shell commands to proove that you never used your mouse!!! This can be done by typing 'history n' where n is the number of steps it took you to get the treasure.
You also need to change the names of the files containing the key and the chest to 'my_key.txt' and 'my_treasure.txt' respectively.
Good luck!

_hint_ A vist to Long John Silver my help!
